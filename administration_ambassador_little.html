<tr><td>2015-03-20 22:22:30</td><td>The White House made clear for a second straight day that it had little faith in Netanyahu's effort to backtrack since winning Tuesday's election and insist he was in favor of a two-state solution, long a cornerstone of U.S. Middle East policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-20 22:22:30</td><td>"The administration is putting everything on the table except security assistance - and this will allow Netanyahu time to walk back his comments more credibly," said Daniel Kurtzer, former U.S. ambassador to Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-20 22:22:30</td><td>But European governments incensed by Netanyahu's campaign comments against Palestinian statehood, could join in another push for such a resolution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-20 22:22:30</td><td>Other possibilities include Obama's cutting back on future one-on-one encounters with Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-20 22:22:30</td><td>White House officials have left little doubt that Netanyahu's U.S. ambassador, Ron Dermer, has been largely frozen out by parts of the administration for his role in orchestrating Netanyahu's speech to Congress this month against Obama's Iran diplomacy.</td></tr>
