<tr><td>2015-04-12 19:45:21</td><td>Hillary Clinton has jumped back into US presidential politics, announcing she will again seek the White House in 2016 with a promise to serve as the champion of "everyday Americans".</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-12 19:45:21</td><td>Unlike eight years ago, when she ran and lost to Barack Obama, Clinton and her personal history weren't the focus of the first message of her campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-12 19:45:21</td><td>"Americans have fought their way back from tough economic times. But the deck is still stacked in favour of those at the top. Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion," Clinton said near the end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-12 20:01:43</td><td>The 67-year-old Clinton brings a long public record to her second bid for the White House, a history that will both help and hurt her candidacy.</td></tr>
