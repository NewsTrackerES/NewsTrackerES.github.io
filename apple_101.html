But I don't think the litigation has served all the purposes that Apple and Samsung originally desired," said Michael Carrier, a Rutgers law professor who has followed the dispute closely.</td></tr><tr><td>Although it upheld the patent claims, the Washington, D.C.-based appeals court said Apple wasn't entitled to damages for its claims that Samsung had copied the iPhone's "trade dress" or overall appearance.</td></tr><tr><td>The long-running case was one of several lawsuits in which Apple, Samsung and other tech companies locked horns in a global battle for pre-eminence in the smartphone market.</td></tr><tr><td>While Apple won large monetary awards by arguing that Samsung copied some of its products, it had less success in persuading courts to issue injunctions that would have kept Samsung's versions off the market.</td></tr><tr><td>But since then, the California company's latest iPhone models have been phenomenally popular - and profitable - while Samsung has lost ground in key markets to competitors ranging from Apple to China's Xiaomi.</td></tr><tr><td>Samsung and Apple agreed last year to settle all patent disputes still pending outside the United States.</td></tr></table></td></tr>
