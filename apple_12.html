<tr><td>2015-03-30 15:19:11</td><td>CHICAGO (AP) - An apple a day doesn't necessarily keep the doctor away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-30 15:19:11</td><td>That's according to proverb-busting research that found daily apple eaters had just as many doctor visits as those who ate fewer or no apples.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-30 15:19:11</td><td>A preliminary analysis found apple eaters had slightly fewer visits than apple avoiders - those who ate less than one daily or no apples.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-30 15:19:11</td><td>About 9 percent of adults studied ate the equivalent of at least one small apple daily.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-30 15:19:11</td><td>Those who ate less than that were considered apple shunners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-30 15:19:11</td><td>Apple eaters had more education and were less likely to smoke than apple shunners, and fewer of them were white.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-30 15:19:11</td><td>Apple eaters were slightly less likely to use prescription drugs, but the study lacks information on use of over-the-counter medication and alternative medicine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-30 15:19:11</td><td>Apples are a good source of vitamin C; one medium apple has about 100 calories and provides nearly 20 percent of the daily recommended amount of fiber.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-30 15:19:20</td><td>But, said Dr. Steven Zeisel, director of the University of North Carolina's Nutrition Research Institute, "One apple isn't going to be enough to make a difference unless it's part of a healthy food pattern."</td></tr>
