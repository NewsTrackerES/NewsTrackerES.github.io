<tr><td>2015-04-08 18:17:11</td><td>"After using it, I had no question that the Apple Watch is the most advanced piece of wearable technology you can buy today," Bloomberg's Josh Topolsky wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-08 18:17:11</td><td>"The Apple Watch is cool, it's beautiful, it's powerful and it's easy to use. But it's not essential. Not yet."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-08 18:17:11</td><td>Apple has lined up several partners -- including ESPN, CNN, Facebook, Twitter, MLB.com, the New York Times and Fandango -- whose apps provide text-based alerts to wearers of the Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-08 18:17:11</td><td>But, according to New York Times tech columnist Farhad Manjoo, while he generally liked the Apple Watch after a "steep" learning curve, the third-party apps available for the device are "mostly useless right now."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-08 18:17:11</td><td>As Manjoo concluded: "The first Apple Watch may not be for you -- but someday soon, it will change your world."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-08 18:17:11</td><td>The fact that the Apple Watch relies on an iPhone being in the close proximity for most of its functions to work was also seen by some reviewers as a drawback.</td></tr>
