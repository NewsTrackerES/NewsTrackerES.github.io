Mencken.</td></tr><tr><td>But the story of Baltimore is much the same as the rest of urban America since World War II; industry left, and fortune followed.</td></tr><tr><td>As droves of city residents left the city for the suburbs, thousands of Baltimore's row homes - some with castle-like spires on top - were left abandoned.</td></tr><tr><td>Today, there are almost 17,000 vacant houses in Baltimore.</td></tr><tr><td>In October, the city's housing authority opened its lottery for public housing units to Baltimore residents for the first time in 10 years.</td></tr></table></td></tr>
