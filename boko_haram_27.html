<tr><td>2015-03-23 18:06:44</td><td>Boko Haram appears to have been weakened by a sustained regional fight-back, but there are growing fears the group could target vulnerable people displaced by the violence as elections approach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-23 18:06:44</td><td>Now, it is feared that internally displaced people (IDP) could be next, after Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau vowed to disrupt this Saturday's elections, which the group views as "un-Islamic".</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-23 18:06:44</td><td>The discovery backs up previous claims about the danger of Boko Haram infiltrating the camps, including from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Maiduguri last August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-23 18:06:44</td><td>The Kano state government also shut a camp it had opened for people displaced from the town of Mubi in Adamawa, after a Boko Haram insurgent was uncovered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-23 18:06:44</td><td>"One cannot dismiss the political element in the Boko Haram insurgency and the planting of bombs in an IDP camp could be a ploy by politicians averse to holding elections in camps because it doesn't favour their political interest," said Wase.</td></tr>
