We\u0027re seeing whole buildings and structures blown away. And those were large buildings - the smaller structures people are living in just didn\u0027t have a chance in category five cyclone.","They would have been picked up \"like confetti\" by the winds, Ms Morrison said, as the cyclone ravaged the islands from Friday night to Saturday morning.","A westward change of course put populated areas directly in the path of Cyclone Pam\u0027s 270 kilometer (168 mile) -per-hour winds.","For anybody who wasn\u0027t in a secure shelter during the cyclone \"it would have been a very, very tough time for them,\" she said.","UNICEF estimated that 54,000 children were among those affected by the cyclone.","\"People are really upset and it\u0027s really hard, just because for the last couple of years, we haven\u0027t received a really big cyclone like this one,\" said Isso Nihmei, Vanuatu coordinator for the environmental and crisis response group 350.","They face long queues, piles of debris and patchy phone reception - but two Australian television producers are thankful they survived Tropical Cyclone Pam in one piece.","While the worst of the storm lasted for just twelve hours, the cyclone has left a lasting mark on the people and infrastructure of Vanuatu, Mr Ang told Fairfax Media while he queued for petrol on the Kumul Highway.","\"Because there\u0027s only one ring road around the island of Efate, that was - and is - the only way to get you out of the north of the Island into town, into Port Vila. During the cyclone, that was ripped up and washed away. So we had to swim across that this afternoon to get to my friend\u0027s car,\" Ang said.","Witnesses described sea surges of up to eight metres (26 feet) and flooding throughout Port Vila after the category 5 cyclone hit.","Looking weary and red-eyed, Baldwin Lonsdale said in an interview Monday with The Associated Press that the latest information he has is that six people are confirmed dead and 30 injured from Cyclone Pam.","Scientists say it\u0027s impossible to attribute single weather events like Cyclone Pam to climate change.","A: \"This is a very devastating cyclone in Vanuatu. I term it as a monster, a monster. It\u0027s a setback for the government and for the people of Vanuatu. After all the development that has taken place, all this development has been wiped out. So it means we will have to start anew again.\"","\"There are over 80 islands that make up Vanuatu and on a good, sunny day outside of cyclone season it\u0027s difficult to get to many of them,\" said Collett van Rooyen of Oxfam.","New Zealand radio journalist Frances Cook and her husband traveled to Vanuatu for their honeymoon two days before the cyclone struck.","Rescue teams reach cyclone stricken Vanuatu islands, official toll lowered","With power, phones and Internet still down across much of the country, officials faced logistical headaches in sorting out where to send supplies, particularly in Tanna Island, which was hit hard by Cyclone Pam\u0027s 168mph winds.","Many locals rode out the cyclone in larger buildings such as schools and churches - a practice that relief groups have impressed upon Vanuatuans as a life-saving measure during storms.","Vanuatu provides lessons in cyclone survival [Photos]","The cyclone wiped out gardens, killed livestock and contaminated the water supply in many areas, and agricultural experts estimate that those displaced by the storm will run out of food in less than a week.","\"People came in on the evening of the cyclone with their own food, water and whatever they need for the night of the cyclone,\" Regina said.","The cyclone has knocked down fruit-bearing trees and destroyed crops across the country.","The agencies do much-needed work by getting supplies to those affected by the cyclone.","The cyclone\u0027s 270 kilometer (168 mile) per hour winds pummeled lush tropical forests on Tanna into a brown jumble of broken trunks and strewn branches.","People living on hard-hit Tanna and many of the other islands may have survived the cyclone, but they have no way of knowing how their relatives or friends are faring elsewhere.","Cyclone crosses remote Australian coast near evacuated island","SYDNEY (Reuters) - Tropical Cyclone Nathan smashed into northern Australia on Tuesday bringing gale-force winds and heavy rainfall to one of the country\u0027s most remote regions.","All 427 of the island\u0027s residents were flown to Darwin for four days in February as category 4 Cyclone Lam bore down, and again for two days this week as category 2 Cyclone Nathan approached, which was forecast to intensify to a category 3.","\"We\u0027d already started talking about it before Cyclone Nathan turned up, but we\u0027ll see what we can put in place.\"","A U.N. appeal for about $30 million was launched on March 24 to cover the needs of 166,000 cyclone-affected people for three months but Dujarric said that to date donors have given only $10.7 million, just 36 per cent.","Similarly, the faster the winds of cyclone spin, the more friction they produce, particularly when the storm makes landfall.","Storms draw their strength from warm sea-surface temperatures, but the resulting churn of the waters and accompanying rain helps to cool conditions, particularly if the cyclone is relatively stationary.","Jonathan Nott, a professor at James Cook University and expert on cyclone history, said there has \"been a lot of discussion over the last five to 10 years\" about the need to extend the cyclone severity rating beyond the current maximum of five.","Low pressure at the eye of the storm, rated a category-5 \"super cyclone\", dipped as low as 890 hectopascals (hPa), said Emma Blades, a meteorologist with the service.","Cyclone Pam was \"certainly one of the biggest storms to occur in the South Pacific\", Kevin Walsh, an associate professor at Melbourne University, said.","The presidents of Vanuatu and Kiribati both drew a clear link between global warming and the cyclone.","\"There is low confidence that long-term changes in tropical cyclone activity are robust, and there is low confidence in the attribution of global changes to any particular cause,\" it said.","Skippers and organisers agreed to hold up the start of the 6,776-nautical mile stage to allow the cyclone to clear the fleet\u0027s planned route up New Zealand\u0027s north island coast.","Round-world fleet sails again as cyclone subsides","As Cyclone Pam ripped at the roof of Manua School, a group of men, women and children pulled desperately on electrical cable keeping them from harm."]
