<tr><td>2015-03-19 04:46:56</td><td>Cyclone Nathan was abut 300 km (185 miles) east-northeast of the holiday town of Cooktown, moving at 8 kph (5 mph) and intensifying as it approached land.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-19 04:46:56</td><td>A month ago, Cyclone Marcia slammed into the southern part of the same coast, causing billions of dollars in damage and leaving thousands homeless or without electricity.</td></tr>
