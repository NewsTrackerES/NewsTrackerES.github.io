<tr><td>2015-03-25 05:41:07</td><td>Washington is considering launching air strikes, possibly within days, to back up Iraqi and Shiite forces battling to recapture Tikrit from the Islamic State jihadist group, US officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-25 05:41:07</td><td>A US-led coalition has targeted IS with air strikes and provided training and equipment to Iraqi forces, but had not previously announced direct assistance for the Tikrit operation, in which Iran has played a major role.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-25 05:41:07</td><td>Possible air strikes near Tikrit are "being discussed at a high level" and could be days or weeks away, a US official told AFP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-25 05:41:07</td><td>But the surveillance flights and discussions on possible US air raids in Tikrit illustrate how Washington is moving towards greater indirect collaboration with Tehran, despite the intense distrust between the two arch-foes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-25 05:41:07</td><td>But capturing Tikrit itself has proved more difficult because of the jihadists' extensive defensive works, including a huge number of bombs planted in streets and buildings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-25 06:01:47</td><td>US mulls air strikes on Tikrit, aids Iraqis with 'eye in the sky'</td></tr>
