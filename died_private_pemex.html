<tr><td>2015-04-02 02:40:04</td><td>MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - At least four people died after a fire broke out on a Pemex oil processing platform in the Gulf of Mexico early on Wednesday, leading to the evacuation of 302 workers, the Mexican state-run oil company said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-02 02:40:04</td><td>Last year, Mexico finalized a reform to end Pemex's 75-year-old oil and gas monopoly, but expectations of a boom in private investment have been tempered by the plunge in global crude prices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-02 03:37:48</td><td>Pemex has had a number of accidents in recent years and the latest one comes as Mexico seeks to lure private investors to revive its flagging oil industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-02 03:37:48</td><td>In 2013, at least 37 people were killed by a blast at Pemex's Mexico City headquarters, and another 26 people died in a fire at a Pemex natural gas facility in northern Mexico in September 2012.</td></tr>
