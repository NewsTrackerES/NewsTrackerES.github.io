<tr><td>2015-02-16 13:38:03</td><td>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) - Students in Liberia began returning to the classroom Monday after a six-month closure during the Ebola epidemic that left thousands dead, lining up in their uniforms to have their temperatures taken before they could enter school gates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-02-16 13:38:03</td><td>"I am very happy to be counted among the living and I pray that Ebola be eradicated from this country."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-02-16 13:38:03</td><td>A few, though, remained a bit fearful about returning even though there are just a handful of Ebola cases left in the country that once saw 100 new patients a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-02-16 13:38:03</td><td>Liberia has seen the highest death toll from the Ebola epidemic, with 3,800 killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-02-16 13:38:03</td><td>In Sierra Leone on Monday, the government promised a full investigation after an internal audit found that nearly one-third of the money it received to fight Ebola was used without saving the necessary receipts and invoices to justify the spending.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-02-17 01:30:51</td><td>Since Ebola is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids, administrators want to minimize the potential spread.</td></tr>
