<tr><td>2015-03-19 22:59:23</td><td>BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders agreed on Thursday that economic sanctions imposed on Russia will stay in place until a Ukraine peace deal is fully implemented, effectively extending them to the end of the year if need be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-19 22:59:23</td><td>The compromise reached at an EU summit in Brussels maintains EU unity on sanctions against Moscow over its role in the Ukraine conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-19 22:59:23</td><td>EU governments were divided on whether to act now to renew economic sanctions on Russia which expire in July or to wait several months before taking a decision to see if the Ukraine ceasefire holds.</td></tr>
