A man is comforted as he mourns the Egyptian Coptic Christians who were captured in Libya and beheaded by Islamic State jihadists, outside of the Virgin Mary church in the village of el-Aour, Egypt.</td></tr><tr><td>For Egypt, already fighting a terrorist insurgency in north Sinai against an IS-affiliated militia, the dangers of being drawn into the rapidly deteriorating security situation in Libya are enormous, analysts say.</td></tr><tr><td>If Egypt progresses from air strikes to troop deployment along its border with Libya, it would be opening a second front in its fight against terrorism, overstretching its military and drawing resources away from Sinai.</td></tr><tr><td>Others warned that Egyptian military intervention could undermine both Egypt and Libya's prospects for stability.</td></tr><tr><td>And while the government in Tobruk supports Egypt's military intervention, the unofficial government in Tripoli does not, describing it as an assault on Libya's sovereignty.</td></tr><tr><td>The Libyan National Army, as General Haftar calls it, is financed by Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, analysts say, while Libya Dawn is backed by Qatar and Turkey.</td></tr><tr><td>With at least 100,000 more Egyptians believed to be in Libya - like those who were murdered, they are labourers seeking work outside Egypt's decimated economy - the government has also committed to helping them return to Egypt.</td></tr><tr><td>In the meantime, Egypt's Minister of Foreign Affairs has travelled to New York to hold talks on Libya with the United Nations Security Council.</td></tr></table></td></tr>
