  <tr><td style='display:none'>0</td><td></td><td>2015-05-16 14:03:21</td><td>Long Egypt's main political opposition, the Brotherhood did not imagine until 2011 it could rule the country, and some argue the decision to seek the presidency was a miscalculation.</td></tr>
  <tr><td style='display:none'>0</td><td></td><td>2015-05-16 14:03:21</td><td>The Brotherhood, which won grassroots support through charity and once dominated professions such as the law, medicine and engineering, has survived crackdowns under successive autocrats in Egypt, birthplace of political Islam.</td></tr>
  <tr><td style='display:none'>0</td><td></td><td>2015-05-16 14:03:21</td><td>Some Egyptians accused Mursi of abusing power and neglecting the economy, which the Brotherhood denies, while rumours he intended to give part or all of Egypt's Sinai Peninsula to Palestinian militant group Hamas added to suspicions about him.</td></tr>
  <tr><td style='display:none'>0</td><td></td><td>2015-05-16 14:03:21</td><td>Egypt has defended its actions against protesters, saying they were given opportunities to disperse peacefully, and blamed Brotherhood militants for the violence.</td></tr>
  <tr><td style='display:none'>0</td><td></td><td>2015-05-16 14:03:21</td><td>Mursi's year-long tenure was Egypt's only period of civilian rule since the overthrow of the monarchy in 1952.</td></tr>
  <tr><td style='display:none'>0</td><td></td><td>2015-05-16 14:03:21</td><td>But the defiance of the country's first freely elected president, who dreamed of creating an "Egyptian renaissance with an Islamic foundation", appears increasingly irrelevant amid the toughest crackdown on Islamists in Egypt's history.</td></tr>
