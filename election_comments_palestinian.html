<tr><td>2015-03-19 23:50:02</td><td>An official statement put out later in the day said Obama called Netanyahu to congratulate him on his election win and used the opportunity to reaffirm his commitment to a two-state solution, a longtime cornerstone of U.S. policy on the Middle East conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-19 23:50:02</td><td>"What has changed is the reality," Netanyahu said, citing the Palestinian Authority's refusal to recognize Israel as the homeland of the Jewish people and the Hamas militant group's continued control of the Gaza Strip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-19 23:50:02</td><td>The harsh U.S. response signaled that relations with Israel, already at their lowest point since Obama took office, could deteriorate further as an end-of-March deadline looms in U.S.-led nuclear diplomacy with Iran that Netanyahu vehemently opposes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-19 23:50:02</td><td>The White House official said in the phone call Obama "also discussed Prime Minister Netanyahu's comments about Israeli Arabs" but gave no details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-19 23:50:02</td><td>Even as he backed away from his pre-election statement rejecting Palestinian statehood, Netanyahu made clear that he believed for now political and security conditions were not amenable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-19 23:57:30</td><td>Obama's telephone call to Netanyahu followed a television interview in which the Israeli leader backed away from his pre-election declaration that there would be no Palestinian state on his watch, an about-face apparently aimed at quelling U.S. criticism triggered by his comments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-20 03:14:22</td><td>White House spokesman Josh Earnest warned earlier that there would be "consequences" for Israel as the Obama administration monitors the formation of Mr Netanyahu's new ruling coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-20 03:14:22</td><td>Mr Netanyahu touched off the diplomatic storm with his comments on the eve of Tuesday's election that he would not allow a Palestinian state, widely seen as intended to mobilise his right-wing base when his electoral hopes were flagging.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-20 03:14:22</td><td>US officials scolded Mr Netanyahu not only for abandoning his commitment to a Palestinian state but also for his election-day accusation that left-wingers were working to get Israel's minority Arab voters out "in droves" to sway the election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-20 03:14:22</td><td>Mr Netanyahu denied he had been trying to suppress the votes of Arab citizens or that his comments were racist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-20 03:14:22</td><td>US to 'reassess' options with Israel, Barack Obama tells Benjamin Netanyahu</td></tr>
