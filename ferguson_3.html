<tr><td>2015-03-23 18:08:18</td><td>Coach Trent Robinson believes Sydney Roosters centre Blake Ferguson is still some way from being back to his best but claims he will be a huge asset to his side later in the NRL season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-23 18:08:18</td><td>Ferguson crossed for two second-half tries in Monday's 20-12 win over Penrith - his first scores for the club in only his third game since ending his exile from the game following his sacking by Canberra in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-23 18:08:18</td><td>Ferguson spoke on Sunday about his desire to put his wild ways behind him and, with a child on the way, is fully aware of the consequences that will follow should he mess up off the field again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-23 18:08:18</td><td>Skipper Pearce said Ferguson's slotted in well with the rest of the squad since his arrival and his defensive efforts were more impressive than his two tries.</td></tr>
