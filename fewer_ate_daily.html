<tr><td>2015-03-30 15:19:11</td><td>That's according to proverb-busting research that found daily apple eaters had just as many doctor visits as those who ate fewer or no apples.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-30 15:19:11</td><td>A preliminary analysis found apple eaters had slightly fewer visits than apple avoiders - those who ate less than one daily or no apples.</td></tr>
