<tr><td>2015-03-26 22:58:43</td><td>Yet, in what Chancellor Angela Merkel described as a "new, simply incomprehensible" dimension to the Germanwings air disaster, it appeared that Lubitz was responsible for the deaths of 149 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-26 22:58:43</td><td>Mr Radker last saw Lubitz last autumn, when the Germanwings pilot returned to the club to renew his light aircraft flying licence and take part in the club's barbecue, which he attended with a girlfriend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-26 22:58:43</td><td>Carsten Spohr, the chief executive of Lufthansa, Germanwings' parent company, said that Lubitz "took a break in his training six years ago. Then he did the tests [technical and psychological] again. And he was deemed 100 per cent fit to fly".</td></tr>
