<tr><td>2015-03-26 23:25:49</td><td>NEW YORK/BERLIN (Reuters) - Lufthansa subsidiary Germanwings could face liabilities well above the typical ceiling in airline crashes for the passengers who died on Tuesday when one of its jets was flown into an Alpine mountain, some aviation lawyers said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-26 23:25:49</td><td>"Given this scenario and what we know at the moment, Germanwings would be unlikely to be able to establish a relevant defense," Garner wrote in an email.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-26 23:25:49</td><td>Pilot's actions may add to Germanwings' liability in mountain crash: lawyers</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-26 23:25:49</td><td>The potential lawsuits for additional damages could be filed in any of several jurisdictions, including Germany where Germanwings is based and a number of different home countries of the passengers, such as Spain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-26 23:25:49</td><td>For Germanwings to limit its liability, it would have to establish that it and its employees and agents were not in any way at fault or that the accident had been caused solely by the fault of a third party, said Clive Garner, a partner at the law firm Irwin Mitchell in London.</td></tr>
