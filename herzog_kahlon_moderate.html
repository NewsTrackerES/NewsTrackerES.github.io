<tr><td>2015-03-17 23:35:20</td><td>If Kahlon does go with Netanyahu, it would give the hard-liner a fourth term that, if completed, would make him Israel's longest-serving leader, on par with the nation's founder David Ben Gurion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-17 23:35:20</td><td>Under Netanyahu, Israel has deepened its hold on the West Bank, adding Jewish settlers to the point where the territory may soon become inseparable from Israel proper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-17 23:35:20</td><td>Netanyahu knows the complications of all this and may try to draw in Herzog, to give his government a more moderate character.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-17 23:35:20</td><td>Kahlon seems to dislike Netanyahu intensely, and he certainly has the power to crown Herzog, a mild-mannered lawyer and scion of a venerable family of Zionist founders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-18 00:01:31</td><td>AP ANALYSIS: Advantage Netanyahu in close race</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-18 00:01:31</td><td>With Likud as well as rightist and religious allies, Netanyahu still only commands 57 out of 120 parliament seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-18 00:01:31</td><td>Breaking away from Netanyahu's nationalist Likud two years ago after a falling out with the premier, he adopted a vaguely centrist platform and flirted with Isaac Herzog's more moderate Zionist Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-18 00:24:58</td><td>It is not inconceivable that the left's desire to unseat Netanyahu extends to offering Kahlon a rotation as prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-18 17:29:51</td><td>JERUSALEM - Benjamin Netanyahu's apparent reelection puts Israel on a course toward ever deeper confrontation with the world.</td></tr>
