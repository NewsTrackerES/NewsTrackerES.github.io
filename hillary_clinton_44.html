<tr><td>2015-04-12 20:45:05</td><td>This time, her aides have said for days, the focus will be on the American people, not on Clinton on their needs and concerns and not her reach for history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-12 20:45:05</td><td>This time: Only four uses of the word "I" as Clinton moves to make her campaign a communal effort, and one that focuses strongly on the economic unease that has persisted during the two terms of the man who defeated her in 2008, President Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-12 20:45:05</td><td>If Clinton's effort this time is meant to do anything, it is to undo the destructive sense last time that hers was the entitled, imperial candidacy, that she was owed the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-12 20:45:05</td><td>Then an immediate segue to the campaign's economic underpinnings, in rhetoric more associated with Democrats such as fist-shaking populist Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, than Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-12 20:45:05</td><td>The video - let's face it, Clinton's first campaign ad - offers a reproach of that argument.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-13 01:28:00</td><td>Analyzing Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign: 'It's not about me, it's about you'</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-13 01:28:00</td><td>If Hillary Rodham Clinton gets her way, there will be stark differences between her failed 2008 run for president and the White House campaign she embarked upon Sunday -- and not just the end result.</td></tr>
