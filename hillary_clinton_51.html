<tr><td>2015-04-13 16:59:45</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton spent nearly two years tiptoeing around a decision to run for president that much of the political world assumed was a done deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-13 16:59:45</td><td>Clinton didn't make a final call until the holidays.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-13 16:59:45</td><td>She spent her annual Christmas vacation last year in the Dominican Republic wading through 500 pages of memos and polling analysis, and discussing the material with her husband, former two-term President Bill Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-13 16:59:45</td><td>Interviews with nearly 20 people who have spent significant time with Clinton in recent years reveal a decision-making process that was slow, almost painstakingly deliberate, a reflection of Clinton's methodical and cautious nature.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-13 16:59:45</td><td>Clinton didn't shut down talk of another White House run after she left the State Department in early 2013, but she wasn't ready to jump back into presidential politics either.</td></tr>
