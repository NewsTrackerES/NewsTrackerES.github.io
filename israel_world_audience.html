<tr><td>2015-03-04 05:47:31</td><td>In a speech that stirred political intrigue in two countries, Netanyahu told Congress that negotiations underway between Iran and the U.S. would "all but guarantee" that Tehran will get nuclear weapons, a step that the world must avoid at all costs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-04 05:47:31</td><td>Which way it goes for Netanyahu may hinge on whether Israel is in some perceptible way punished by the White House for its leader's extraordinary offensive against a U.S. president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-04 05:47:31</td><td>For this and other reasons, Netanyahu has found himself at increasingly toxic loggerheads with the country's elites - from the security establishment to academics, journalists, cultural figures and much of the business world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-04 05:47:31</td><td>"There is no doubt that Prime Minister Netanyahu knows how to speak," said Herzog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-04 05:54:13</td><td>At home and abroad, Netanyahu is seen by many as a leading obstacle to peace with the Palestinians and perhaps the Arab world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-04 05:54:13</td><td>Under these circumstances, while Netanyahu's speech was delivered to the U.S. Congress, his primary audience may well have been Israel's voters half a world away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-04 11:30:12</td><td>He presented Israel as peace-loving and progressive and stressed its deep bonds to the U.S. He even produced Nobel laureate and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, who waved as Netanyahu intoned "Never Again."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-04 11:30:12</td><td>But the mood in Netanyahu's entourage was upbeat afterward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-04 11:30:12</td><td>And Avraham Diskin, a political scientist at Hebrew University, said that to an Israeli audience Netanyahu's speech was "so exciting, so powerful" that "it will definitely help him in the campaign."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-04 11:30:12</td><td>Although Obama is somewhat unpopular in Israel, if Netanyahu is perceived as having truly unsettled relations with the U.S., it could boomerang.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-04 11:30:12</td><td>And some in Israel fret that if Netanyahu is re-elected, relations with the White House will be poisonous for the remaining two years of Obama's term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-04 11:30:12</td><td>"Netanyahu remains alone and Israel remains isolated," Herzog said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-04 11:30:12</td><td>"I think honest brokers don't do what the congressmen did with Mr. Netanyahu - the man who leads the occupation, the aggression against the people of Palestine," Shaath said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-04 11:30:12</td><td>Israel's opposition will try to turn attention back toward domestic issues, where Netanyahu is more vulnerable, and away from both Iran and the Palestinian issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-04 23:27:53</td><td>Speech fallout could determine Netanyahu?s fate</td></tr>
