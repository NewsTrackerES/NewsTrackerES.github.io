<tr><td>2015-04-05 02:46:14</td><td>Many Garissa residents channelled their emotions by turning out in the traffic-clogged streets on Saturday to view the bodies of four men alleged to have taken part in the assault, even as Somali militants issued a statement threatening Kenya with more attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-05 02:46:14</td><td>As it had with its previous assaults in Kenya, which have claimed the lives of more than 200 Kenyans in the past two years, al-Shabab said the attacks were in retaliation for Kenya's 2011 invasion of Somalia and its continued presence in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-05 02:46:14</td><td>"Since October 2011, Kenya has been the most insecure that we have seen in decades. If going into Somalia was to secure Kenya, then they have failed," said Abdullahi Halakhe, a Horn of Africa analyst with Amnesty International.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-05 02:46:14</td><td>"The elephant in the room is what is Kenya's plan as far as Somalia is concerned? What does the exit plan look like? Is it two years, is it three years?"</td></tr>
