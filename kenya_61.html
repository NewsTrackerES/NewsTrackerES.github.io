And so we will be looking at additional ways that we may be able to support the Kenyan efforts to fight al-Shebab."</td></tr>

So this trip is not about making amends," a State Department official said.</td></tr>
  <tr><td style='display:none'>0</td><td></td><td>2015-05-03 11:32:56</td><td>"It's about reinforcing and deepening the relationship that we have had with Kenya, and it's also partially in preparation for President Obama's trip that's going to take place at the end of July."</td></tr>
  <tr><td style='display:none'>0</td><td></td><td>2015-05-03 11:32:56</td><td>The fight against Somalia's Al-Qaeda-linked Shebab militants will feature high on the agenda, with Kenya struggling to stop increased cross-border attacks by the militants even though it has thousands of troops in southern Somalia.</td></tr>
