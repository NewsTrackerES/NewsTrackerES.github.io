<tr><td>2015-03-02 15:39:51</td><td>The Reuters interview gave Mr Obama a chance to try to pre-emptively blunt the impact of Mr Netanyahu's address to Congress, which will be closely watched.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-02 15:39:51</td><td>Mr Obama also sought to lower the temperature by describing Mr Netanyahu's planned speech to Congress as a distraction that would not be "permanently destructive" to US-Israeli ties and said the rift was not personal.</td></tr>

<tr><td>2015-03-02 15:39:51</td><td>Mr Netanyahu has said such a deal would allow Iran to become a "threshold" nuclear weapons state, that it would inevitably cheat on any agreement and that the lifting of nuclear restrictions in as little of ten years would be an untenable risk to Israel.</td></tr>
