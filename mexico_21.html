<tr><td>2015-03-20 05:14:05</td><td>With a deadline fast approaching, New Mexico lawmakers came together Thursday to approve a gambling compact that will allow a handful of American Indian tribes to continue operating casinos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-20 05:14:05</td><td>Jessica Hernandez, Martinez's deputy chief of staff and lead negotiator, said the compact is more socially responsible and will provide stability for New Mexico's gambling market for another two decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-20 05:14:05</td><td>State officials say the tribes paid New Mexico more than $66 million last year under revenue-sharing agreements that call for the state to ensure gambling exclusivity for them in exchange for a percentage of net winnings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-20 05:14:05</td><td>Nine other New Mexico tribes operate under different compacts with the state.</td></tr>
