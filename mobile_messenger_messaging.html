<tr><td>2015-03-25 23:29:24</td><td>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Facebook's Messenger app is evolving into a multitasking tool equipped to send an animated fist bump to a friend at one moment and then get a little business done in the next.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-25 23:29:24</td><td>Younger people, in particular, are increasingly using a wide range of mobile messaging apps to communicate while spending less time broadcasting their activities on Facebook's more expansive social network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-25 23:29:24</td><td>Thanks largely to its Facebook ties, Messenger already has more than 600 million users, Zuckerberg said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-25 23:29:24</td><td>The growing popularity of mobile messaging, though, could result in less time spent on social networks, a shift that would give Facebook fewer opportunities to learn about its users' interests and show the digital ads that make most of the company's money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-25 23:29:24</td><td>The decision to allow outside applications to operate within Messenger mirrors a pivotal decision that Zuckerberg made eight years ago when he opened Facebook to other programmers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-25 23:29:24</td><td>The push to diversify Messenger addresses a potential threat to Facebook's ubiquitous social network posed by a variety of mobile messaging maps offering more intimate and direct ways to connect with friends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-26 01:00:49</td><td>Facebook is trying to mold its Messenger app into a more versatile communications channel as smartphones create new ways for people to connect with friends and businesses beyond the walls of the company's ubiquitous social network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-26 01:00:49</td><td>CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers the keynote address during the Facebook F8 Developer Conference Wednesday, March 25, 2015, in San Francisco.</td></tr>
