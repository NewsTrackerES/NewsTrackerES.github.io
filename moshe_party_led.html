<tr><td>2015-03-18 06:58:25</td><td>In a statement, Likud said Netanyahu intended to form a new government within weeks, with negotiations already underway with the pro-settler Jewish Home party led by Naftali Bennett, as well as with religious groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-18 06:58:25</td><td>The critical party to get on side will be centrist Kulanu, led by former Likud member Moshe Kahlon, who won 10 seats, making him a kingmaker given his ability to side with either Netanyahu or the center-left opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-18 06:58:25</td><td>"Reality is not waiting for us," Netanyahu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-18 06:58:25</td><td>Despite the numbers stacking up in Netanyahu's favor, Zionist Union leader Isaac Herzog said "everything is still open" and that he already had spoken to party leaders about the possibility of forming a government, although the arithmetic for him is much harder to achieve than for Netanyahu.</td></tr>
