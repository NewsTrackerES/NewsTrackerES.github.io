<tr><td>2015-03-02 15:25:12</td><td>MOSCOW - Boris Nemtsov's girlfriend has broken her public silence on the murder of the Russian opposition activist, saying she did not see the killer who gunned him down as they strolled across a bridge near the Kremlin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-02 15:25:12</td><td>Speaking largely without emotion in deadened monosyllables, Ukrainian fashion model Anna Duritskaya said she had little recollection of what happened in the moments after Nemtsov was shot dead on Friday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-02 15:25:12</td><td>It had not occurred to her that someone might be following them as they headed across the river towards Nemtsov's apartment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-02 15:25:12</td><td>Nemtsov, 55, was shot several times and killed instantly, becoming the most prominent opposition figure to be murdered during President Vladimir Putin's 15-year rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-02 15:25:12</td><td>Duritskaya, who is 23 or 24, said she had been under constant guard since the murder and would probably be unable to attend Nemtsov's funeral on Tuesday.</td></tr>
