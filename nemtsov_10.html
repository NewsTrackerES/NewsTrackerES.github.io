  <tr><td style='display:none'>0</td><td></td><td>2015-03-03 11:50:49</td><td>Many opposition supporters suspect the killing was ordered by the Kremlin in retaliation for Nemtsov's ardent criticism of President Vladimir Putin, while authorities have suggested several possible motives, including a provocation aimed at tarnishing Putin's image.</td></tr>
  <tr><td style='display:none'>0</td><td></td><td>2015-03-03 11:50:49</td><td>Some observers speculated that certain members of a hawkish, isolationist wing of the government could have had a hand in Nemtsov's death, possibly counting on it to provoke outrage abroad and further strain Russia's ties with the West.</td></tr>
  <tr><td style='display:none'>0</td><td></td><td>2015-03-03 11:50:49</td><td>Many commentators said that, like other key opposition leaders, Nemtsov was constantly being shadowed by police, so it would be hard to imagine that his killing could go unnoticed by them.</td></tr>
