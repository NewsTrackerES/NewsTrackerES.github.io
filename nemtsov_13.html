<tr><td>2015-04-12 08:45:17</td><td>Adam Osmayev hailed Nemtsov as a "true hero" both for condemning Russia's war against separatists in Chechnya and for decrying Russian intervention in the current conflict in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-12 08:45:17</td><td>Osmayev denies involvement and no evidence has been presented linking him to the hit on Nemtsov, who was a relentless critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-12 08:45:17</td><td>Within days of Nemtsov's assassination, investigators arrested five Chechens, including a senior officer in Kadyrov's police force, and charged them with carrying out the killing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-12 08:50:13</td><td>Osmayev said he has few doubts that the perpetrators of Nemtsov's killing have ties to Kadyrov, but that the security services now need a convenient scapegoat whose guilt would be easily acceptable to the Russian general public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-12 08:50:13</td><td>"The fact the FSB is . trying to somehow implicate me in Nemtsov's murder is utterly ridiculous," Osmayev said, "but not hard to believe now that I am involved in the situation here in Ukraine."</td></tr>
