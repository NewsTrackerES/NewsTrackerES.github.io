<tr><td>2015-03-03 20:13:11</td><td>FACT CHECK: Did Netanyahu go too far in US speech?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-03 20:13:11</td><td>On the whole, Netanyahu largely adhered to what is known about the nuclear negotiations between world powers and Iran, even if he predicted far direr consequences for the Middle East and the world if a deal is reached this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-03 20:13:11</td><td>Still, Netanyahu exaggerated at times for dramatic effect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-03 20:13:11</td><td>On advanced centrifuges, Netanyahu noted that their installation would cut the timespan even more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-03 20:13:11</td><td>THE FACTS: Though vague, Netanyahu's assessments on facilities and centrifuges are reasonable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-03 20:13:11</td><td>NETANYAHU: "True, certain restrictions would be imposed on Iran's nuclear program and Iran's adherence to those restrictions would be supervised by international inspectors. But here's the problem. You see, inspectors document violations; they don't stop them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-03 22:41:58</td><td>Netanyahu said his government's understanding of the agreement means that window would be narrower.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-03 22:41:58</td><td>NETANYAHU: "According to the deal, not a single nuclear facility would be demolished. Thousands of centrifuges used to enrich uranium would be left spinning. Thousands more would be temporarily disconnected, but not destroyed."</td></tr>
