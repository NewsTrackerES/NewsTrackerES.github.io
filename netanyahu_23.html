<tr><td>2015-03-15 18:21:27</td><td>The son of a Jewish historian, and scarred by the loss of his brother in a 1976 Israeli commando raid on a hijacked airline in Uganda, Netanyahu often portrays himself - and his country - in historical terms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-15 18:21:27</td><td>It was vintage Netanyahu, delivered in flawless, American-accented English - developed during a childhood in Philadelphia and later as a university student at MIT - and with the gifted oratorical flourish that has made him prominent on the international stage.</td></tr>

<tr><td>2015-03-15 18:21:42</td><td>JERUSALEM (AP) - As Israelis prepare to vote in parliament elections on Tuesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu finds himself at a fateful crossroads: Make history or become history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-15 18:21:42</td><td>But if Likud stumbles and finds itself in the opposition - a real possibility, according to recent polls - the Netanyahu era could end with a resounding thud, concluding a career that many would say brought few major accomplishments beyond longevity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-15 22:02:59</td><td>The Israeli campaign is widely seen as a choice between two world views: Netanyahu?s focus on Israel?s many security challenges?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-15 23:03:53</td><td>The speech, delivered over White House objections, has worsened an already troubled relationship with President Barack Obama, boding poorly for the final two years of Obama's term if Netanyahu is re-elected.</td></tr>
