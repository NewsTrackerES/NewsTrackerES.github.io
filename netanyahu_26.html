<tr><td>2015-03-16 07:50:22</td><td>Netanyahu, who has governed for the past six years and has long been the most dominant personality in Israeli politics, has watched his standing plummet in recent weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-16 07:50:22</td><td>Tuesday's election caps an acrimonious three-month campaign that is widely seen as a referendum on Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-16 07:50:22</td><td>The hard-line leader has portrayed himself as the only politician capable of confronting Israel's numerous security challenges, while his opponents have focused on the country's high cost of living and presented Netanyahu as imperious and out of touch with the common man.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-16 07:50:22</td><td>As Netanyahu's poll numbers have dropped in recent days, he has appeared increasingly desperate, stepping up his nationalistic rhetoric in a series of interviews to local media to appeal to his core base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-16 07:50:22</td><td>Netanyahu has also complained of an international conspiracy to oust him, funded by wealthy foreigners who dislike him, and on Sunday night, he addressed an outdoor rally before tens of thousands of hard-line supporters in Tel Aviv.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-16 09:31:32</td><td>Netanyahu dissolved his government in December and ordered the new election, two years ahead of schedule, in the belief that he would cruise to a new term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-16 09:31:32</td><td>On Monday, it was Herzog, Netanyahu's chief rival, who appeared confident and upbeat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-16 09:31:32</td><td>He accused both Netanyahu and Herzog of working outside deals with special interest groups and said that only he was tackling the real issues facing the Israeli middle class.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-16 09:31:32</td><td>Lapid has so far refused to commit to either Herzog or Netanyahu, though he is widely seen as a natural ally of Herzog's in a future coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-16 09:31:32</td><td>Kahlon, who broke off from Netanyahu's Likud, is demanding to become finance minister in the next government and has given no indication as to whom he would prefer as prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-16 19:10:05</td><td>Netanyahu's tough new position is likely to worsen his already strained ties with his western allies if he is re-elected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-16 19:10:05</td><td>Palestinian official Hanan Ashrawi said Netanyahu's comments were "dangerous" and could plunge the region into violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-16 19:10:05</td><td>Earlier, Netanyahu paid a last-minute visit to Har Homa, a Jewish development in east Jerusalem that Netanyahu helped build during his first term as prime minister in 1997.</td></tr>
