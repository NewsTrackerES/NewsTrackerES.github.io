<tr><td>2015-03-18 13:15:21</td><td>Netanyahu's surprise victory, after pledging in the final days of the campaign that there would be no Palestinian state as long as he was in power, left Palestinians grim about prospects for a negotiated solution to a decades-old conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-18 13:15:21</td><td>Seeking to shore up right-wing votes and saying that Islamist militants would move into any territory relinquished by Israel, Netanyahu also vowed to keep building settlements on occupied land Palestinians seek for a state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-18 13:15:21</td><td>Netanyahu's stand against a Palestinian state had already threatened to strain ties with the United States and Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-18 13:15:21</td><td>In his new coalition, Netanyahu is expected to include his natural allies, religious and far-right parties, as well as one centrist party which campaigned on internal social-economic issues rather than on matters of war and peace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-18 13:15:21</td><td>"Netanyahu's masquerade is over. Everything's clear now, we're talking about a man who has sworn allegiance to the right, not about a centrist," Oppenheimer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-18 13:15:21</td><td>Though Israeli officials have indicated no imminent change, Gaza-based political analyst Hani Habeeb said Netanyahu may unfreeze the funds, which cover around two-thirds of the Palestinian budget, now that the election is over.</td></tr>

<tr><td>2015-03-18 14:38:01</td><td>Netanyahu, who in 2009 had endorsed the two-state solution, seemed on course to form a coalition government leaning further to the right than his outgoing cabinet, which had included two centrist parties and engaged in the U.S-brokered peace talks.</td></tr>
