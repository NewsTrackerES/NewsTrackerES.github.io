<tr><td>2015-03-19 10:58:32</td><td>Netanyahu's Likud won 30 seats in the 120-seat parliament, and parties apparently willing to back him won another 37 for a possible majority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-19 10:58:32</td><td>The reasons for that outcome go beyond the party's nationalist ideology and include Israel's sense of geographic vulnerability, its fragmented politics and a master campaigner in Netanyahu himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-19 10:58:32</td><td>JERUSALEM (AP) - It's a mystery to many: Benjamin Netanyahu's campaign gained steam when he ruled out the creation of a Palestinian state, and he seems determined to continue settling occupied land with Jews.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-19 11:03:14</td><td>Analysis: Why Netanyahu? It's more than just nationalism</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-19 11:03:14</td><td>The fact that Islamic State militants are menacing the region does not help, and was exploited by Netanyahu during a campaign in which he portrayed the militants in one TV ad as charging toward Jerusalem, with naive Israeli leftists even helpfully pointing the way.</td></tr>
