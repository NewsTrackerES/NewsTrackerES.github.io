<tr><td>2015-03-19 16:34:30</td><td>The question is whether Netanyahu - who shifted sharply to the right in the last days of his campaign, using messages such as the 'no-state' pledge to successfully draw right-wing votes away from ultranationalist parties - really meant what he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-19 16:34:30</td><td>"I don't want a one-state solution. I want a sustainable, peaceful two-state solution. But for that circumstances have to change," Netanyahu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-19 16:34:30</td><td>If the Palestinian leadership changes - Abbas has talked about elections but no dates have been set - Netanyahu would find himself under intense pressure to reengage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-19 16:34:30</td><td>But for now, even U.S. diplomats acknowledge that getting Abbas and Netanyahu back together to negotiate is highly improbable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-19 16:34:30</td><td>Instead, Netanyahu's dismissal of two states will encourage the Palestinians to again seek recognition via the United Nations as well as bilaterally - 135 of 193 UN members already recognize the State of Palestine, including several EU member states, even if the EU itself does not.</td></tr>
