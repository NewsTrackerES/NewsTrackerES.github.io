<tr><td>2015-03-20 17:57:05</td><td>The election, in which Netanyahu eventually secured his fourth term, highlighted the fraught relationship between Israel's Arab citizens and the Jewish state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-20 17:57:05</td><td>In what was seen as an attempt to galvanize his hard-line supporters during Tuesday's election, Netanyahu had warned that "Arab voters are going in droves to the polls," with the help of "left-wing" activists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-20 17:57:05</td><td>After initially trailing in opinion polls, Netanyahu's Likud Party did well in traditional strongholds, including working class towns with large numbers of Sephardic Jews of Middle Eastern descent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-20 17:57:05</td><td>Netanyahu, defending his record amid widespread criticism of his election-day remarks, told NBC that his government has spent "billions" in Arab towns to upgrade infrastructure and schools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-20 17:57:05</td><td>Asked by NPR if he would engage in fence-mending, given how his remarks were received, Netanyahu said: "Well, I certainly will make sure that everybody understands that I'm the prime minister of all of Israel's citizens, and I really believe that. It's something that my actions have shown. It's not a question of fence-mending, it's a question of real belief, and it's there. I don't have to fabricate it."</td></tr>
