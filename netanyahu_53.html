  <tr><td style='display:none'>0</td><td></td><td>2015-03-23 18:14:12</td><td>Netanyahu drew accusations of racism in Israel, especially from its Arab minority, and a White House rebuke when, just a few hours before polling stations were to close across the country, he warned that Arab citizens were voting "in droves."</td></tr>
  <tr><td style='display:none'>0</td><td></td><td>2015-03-23 19:50:00</td><td>In the final days of the campaign, Netanyahu angered the U.S. by taking a tough stance toward the Palestinians and by saying a Palestinian state will not be established on his watch in the current climate of regional chaos and violence.</td></tr>
