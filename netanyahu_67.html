<tr><td>2015-03-26 19:41:23</td><td>As Netanyahu formally accepted Wednesday the task of building a government, he pledged Israel would hold out a "hand of peace" to the Palestinians and make sure to patch up US ties, while continuing to fight the Iran deal.</td></tr>

<tr><td>2015-03-26 19:41:23</td><td>But the party boycotted their opening meeting with Likud on Thursday, after hearing Netanyahu intended to hand the chairmanship of the parliamentary finance committee to UTJ.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-26 19:41:23</td><td>Representatives of the four other parties met with Likud's negotiating team throughout the day, with statements from Netanyahu's party providing no details.</td></tr>
