<tr><td>2015-04-20 05:29:35</td><td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - If the U.S. Supreme Court blows up the tax subsidies at the heart of Obamacare in June, Republicans hope to deliver on their promise to offer an alternative healthcare plan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-20 05:29:35</td><td>Republicans deny that their ideas are tantamount to "Obamacare Lite" but acknowledge they will need bipartisan support for their plans to stand any chance of avoiding an Obama veto.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-20 05:29:35</td><td>"It's not going to be like Obamacare, in my opinion," said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, whose plan includes a refundable tax credit for low-and middle-income Americans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-20 05:29:35</td><td>There is renewed interest in producing one now, however, to be ready if the Court rules for the plaintiffs in the current Obamacare case and disallows tax subsidies through the federal exchange in a ruling expected in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-20 05:29:35</td><td>The refundable tax credits in both their plans would be available to those who pay little or no tax, similar to the Obamacare subsidies for low-income Americans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-20 05:29:35</td><td>If the Court rules against the administration, Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson wants to make the Obamacare taxpayer subsidies available through August 2017, while repealing the individual and employer mandates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-20 05:29:35</td><td>Two front-running Republican options at an early stage in Congress include a refundable tax credit that experts say is virtually the same thing as the Obamacare tax subsidy being challenged before the Supreme Court.</td></tr>
