<tr><td>2015-03-26 05:52:26</td><td>Unlike Van Halen, which started over when it replaced Roth with a new lead singer (Sammy Hagar); or Oasis, which essentially disbanded when Gallagher left, One Direction is all vocalists, making it easier to absorb a loss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-26 05:52:26</td><td>"Zayn's exit from One Direction is painful because it means something has ended, but it would have been vastly more painful to approach the next few months with a sense of unsteadiness," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-26 05:52:26</td><td>"Now, Zayn is gone, and One Direction can move on."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-26 05:53:03</td><td>It's too soon to say which way One Direction, or Malik, might go, but making a clean split was a good first step, writes Jason Lipshutz, an associate editor at Billboard.</td></tr>
