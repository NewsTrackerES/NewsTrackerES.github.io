<tr><td>2015-03-17 14:25:31</td><td>? A Penn State University fraternity was suspended for a year Tuesday after police began investigating allegations that members used a private, invitation-only Facebook page to post photos of nude and partly nude women, some apparently asleep or passed out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-17 14:25:31</td><td>"The evidence offered by the Facebook postings is appalling, offensive and inconsistent" with the university's expectations, Damon Sims, Penn State's vice president for student affairs, said in a news release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-17 14:25:31</td><td>Facebook was contacted to disable the site and to obtain more information for the investigation, Robb said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-17 14:25:31</td><td>According to the ex-fraternity member who went to police, a second page dubbed "2.0" was started in about April 2014 after a woman depicted on the first Facebook page, called "Covert Business Transactions," complained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-17 14:25:31</td><td>The informant said the woman was visiting the fraternity when a member accidentally left his Facebook page logged in, and she noticed a topless photograph of her had been posted to the group.</td></tr>
