<tr><td>2015-03-18 00:43:36</td><td>U.S. officials responded cautiously as they waited to see whether Netanyahu or his center-left challenger, Isaac Herzog, would get the nod from Israel's president to begin the long and messy coalition-building process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-18 00:43:36</td><td>Clearly the result that many of Obama's supporters had hoped for - a repudiation by Israeli voters of Netanyahu's hard-line approach - was not to be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-18 00:43:36</td><td>The election came just two weeks after Netanyahu defied Obama with a politically divisive speech to Congress attacking U.S.-led nuclear talks with Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-18 00:43:36</td><td>Even as they insisted publicly on non-intervention in the Israeli campaign, Obama's aides were taken aback by Netanyahu's reversal of his previous declaration of support for creating a Palestinian state, a longstanding cornerstone of U.S. policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-18 00:43:36</td><td>Netanyahu also drew a rebuke from the U.S. State Department for suggesting on election day that left-wingers were trying to get Arab-Israeli voters out "in droves" to sway the election against him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-18 00:43:36</td><td>"Netanyahu has managed an uphill climb in the last few days," said David Makovsky, a former member of Obama's team in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks that collapsed last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-18 06:50:19</td><td>Washington - After six years of testy relations, US President Barack Obama may have to resign himself to the likelihood that he has not seen the last of Benjamin Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-18 06:50:19</td><td>That prospect may not bode well for repairing US-Israeli ties after Netanyahu's congressional speech, which he delivered at the invitation of Obama's Republican opponents despite strong objections from the president and many of Obama's fellow Democrats.</td></tr>
