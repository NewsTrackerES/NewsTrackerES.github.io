<tr><td>2015-03-17 15:06:09</td><td>Iraq's offensive to retake Tikrit from the Islamic State group was stalled Tuesday because of streets and buildings rigged with booby trap bombs and by the several hundred jihadists still holding out there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-17 15:06:09</td><td>"The battle to retake Tikrit will be difficult because of the preparations (IS) made," said Jawwad al-Etlebawi, spokesman for Asaib Ahl al-Haq, a Shiite militia playing a major role in the operation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-17 15:06:09</td><td>Staff Lieutenant General Abdulwahab al-Saadi, commander for Salaheddin, told AFP Sunday his forces in Tikrit needed air support from the US-led coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-17 15:06:09</td><td>The longer the operation drags on, the longer civilians remaining in Tikrit twill be caught in the middle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-17 15:06:09</td><td>Adnan Yunis, spokesman for the Red Crescent in Salaheddin, said only a maximum 20 percent of Tikrit's pre-conflict population is believed to remain in the city.</td></tr>
