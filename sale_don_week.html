<tr><td>2015-04-17 17:44:20</td><td>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - If you're planning on buying the new Apple Watch, don't expect to walk into a store and leave with one next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-17 17:44:20</td><td>Apple, which began accepting advance orders for the watch last week, had previously said it would be "available" for sale in stores on April 24, at least for customers who made reservations to come in for a personal demonstration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-17 17:44:20</td><td>But with supplies limited, Apple's retail chief has told store workers that the watch will continue to be sold only through online orders for at least the next several weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-17 17:44:20</td><td>That's a departure from the way the way Apple has launched other new products, such as its popular iPhones, which have been offered for sale in stores to customers who often arrived hours early and lined up outside before the first day of a new release.</td></tr>
