They want to become Jihad Jane types," said Huckerby.</td></tr><tr><td>She said this shift was flagged in a recent manifesto by Islamic State's all-female Al-Khansaa Brigade whose mission is to pursue and arrest women who break the group's strict rules on Islamist morality.</td></tr><tr><td>"Female fighters have started to arrive on the frontline. It might means that (Islamic State) are in difficulties and they are starting to use everybody to help them fight," he said.</td></tr></table></td></tr>
