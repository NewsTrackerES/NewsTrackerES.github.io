Now it has become riskier to dismantle them," said Bahadir Dincer, Middle East Expert at the Ankara-based think-tank USAK.</td></tr><tr><td>"A Daesh (Islamic State) attack is the number one threat for Turkey at the moment ... This is a huge risk for the government before the elections."</td></tr><tr><td>Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has estimated that the number of Turks who have joined Islamic State is around 500-700, lower than from some European countries, although some diplomats put the number of Turks in the thousands.</td></tr><tr><td>There have been dozens of detentions and deportations in recent months, most recently a British couple with four young children suspected of trying to travel to an Islamic State-controlled part of Syria.</td></tr><tr><td>He vehemently denies that his small community of followers, many of whom read his sermons and articles online, has links to either al Qaeda or Islamic State.</td></tr></table></td></tr>
