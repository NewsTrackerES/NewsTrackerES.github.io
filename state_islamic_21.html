<tr><td>2015-03-08 06:20:18</td><td>New York: One of the deadliest terrorist organisations in Africa has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, according to a message posted online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-08 06:20:18</td><td>If confirmed, the pledge would make the group, Boko Haram, which is believed to have as many as 6,000 fighters, the largest extremist group to date to agree to fight under the Islamic State banner, analysts said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-08 06:20:18</td><td>In the message published on his Twitter account on Saturday, Abubakar Shekau, Boko Haram's leader, announced that he had sworn allegiance to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-08 06:20:18</td><td>Terrorism experts say that the pledge, or "bayat", is a spiritually binding oath, and it indicates that Boko Haram's leader agrees to be under the authority of the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-08 06:20:18</td><td>If confirmed, the agreement with Boko Haram would mirror the steps taken by Islamic State affiliates in Libya, Algeria, Egypt, Afghanistan and beyond.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-08 06:20:18</td><td>But as with such pledges from other groups elsewhere in the world, including in Libya, it remains unclear how much direct control the Islamic State leaders have over their distant proxies.</td></tr>
