<tr><td>2015-04-02 00:02:44</td><td>Islamic State seized large sections of north and west Iraq and much of eastern Syria last year and the Iraqi government, with its Western and Iranian allies, is now trying to recapture the nearly one-third of Iraq under the jihadists' control.</td></tr>

<tr><td>2015-04-02 00:02:44</td><td>"A number of Western women who traveled to (Islamic State)have expressed their willingness to fight and to be in combat. They want to become Jihad Jane types," said Huckerby.</td></tr>
