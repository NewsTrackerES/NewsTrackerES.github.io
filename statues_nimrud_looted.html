<tr><td>2015-03-06 10:07:36</td><td>Baghdad: Islamic State fighters have looted and bulldozed the ancient Assyrian city of Nimrud, the Iraqi government says, in their latest assault on some of the world's greatest archaeological and cultural treasures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-06 10:07:36</td><td>"Islamic State members came to the Nimrud archaeological city and looted the valuables in it and then they proceeded to level the site to the ground," the source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-06 10:07:36</td><td>Islamic State, which rules a self-declared caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria, promotes a fiercely purist interpretation of Sunni Islam which seeks its inspiration from early Islamic history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-06 10:07:36</td><td>"There used to be statues and walls as well as a castle that Islamic State has destroyed completely."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-06 10:07:36</td><td>The assault against Nimrud came just a week after the release of a video showing Islamic State forces smashing museum statues and carvings in Mosul, the city they seized along with much of northern Iraq last June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-06 11:47:53</td><td>"Daesh terrorist gangs continue to defy the will of the world and the feelings of humanity," Iraq's tourism and antiquities ministry said, referring to Islamic State by its Arabic acronym.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-06 11:47:53</td><td>But the damage wreaked by Islamic State, not just to ancient monuments but also on some Muslim places of worship, has been swift, relentless and more wide-ranging.</td></tr>
