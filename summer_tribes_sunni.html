<tr><td>2015-04-05 13:02:25</td><td>Sunni tribes played a key role during the U.S. occupation fighting back al-Qaida in Iraq, the Islamic State group's predecessor, and their distrust of Baghdad's Shiite-led government eased the extremists' takeover last summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-05 13:02:25</td><td>By December 2013, security forces withdrew from Ramadi after dismantling a protest camp, allowing Islamic State militants ultimately to take it over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-05 13:02:25</td><td>When the Islamic State group swept across a third of Iraq last summer, many Sunnis initially greeted them as liberators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-05 13:02:25</td><td>The few Sunni tribes that stood up against the Islamic State group have paid a heavy price.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-05 13:02:25</td><td>With Tikrit taken, Sunni residents in Islamic State-held Anbar province, home to Fallujah, and Nineveh province, home to Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, expect the Iraqi offensive to now turn its attention to their regions.</td></tr>
