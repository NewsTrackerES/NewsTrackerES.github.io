<tr><td>2015-04-05 13:02:25</td><td>With Tikrit taken, Sunni residents in Islamic State-held Anbar province, home to Fallujah, and Nineveh province, home to Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, expect the Iraqi offensive to now turn its attention to their regions.</td></tr>

<tr><td>2015-04-05 13:02:25</td><td>Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has called on security forces to halt looting and vandalism in Tikrit, promising a fund would be established to help residents return to Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-05 13:04:43</td><td>Efforts to merge small, but symbolic Sunni battalions with the Iraqi military were tested in the Tikrit battle, with as many as 200 men, mainly from al-Jabour tribe, joining government-backed forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-06 02:34:00</td><td>The objective is ultimately to plant the seed for a local national guard force that would remain in Tikrit and other recaptured cities.</td></tr>
