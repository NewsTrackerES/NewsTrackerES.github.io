<tr><td>2015-03-02 17:37:56</td><td>Iraq's military says some 2,000 Shiite militia fighters have arrived near the town of Tikrit in preparation for a major operation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-02 17:37:56</td><td>So far local reports indicated the army, backed by as many as 27,000 soldiers as well as Iraqi fighter jets and helicopters, had attacked the city from three sides but had yet to make it inside Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-02 17:37:56</td><td>Volunteer Shiite fighters fire an artillery canon near the city of Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-02 17:37:56</td><td>Along with opening up a key supply route for any future military operation to take back Mosul from IS, the campaign in Tikrit will show the measure of the Iraqi Army, which suffered a humiliating defeat last June when thousands of its soldiers abandoned their posts to IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-02 17:37:56</td><td>Tikrit was the scene of one of the first and largest massacres conducted by IS, when it kidnapped and murdered hundreds of Iraqi security forces from the nearby military base of Camp Speicher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-02 17:37:56</td><td>"This operation [in Tikrit] therefore likely has major support from Iraq's Shiite communities, which bore the brunt of these losses . . . and are therefore highly motivated to deal a counterblow in this symbolic area," the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said.</td></tr>
