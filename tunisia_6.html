<tr><td>2015-04-08 14:16:30</td><td>Four years after its revolt, Tunisia is unlikely to slide back to the days of Ben Ali's oppressive state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-08 14:16:30</td><td>"Yes, Tunisia has been hit hard, but we can't let that hurt our rights and freedoms."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-08 14:16:30</td><td>Since its transition to democracy, Tunisia has been praised by the West as a symbol of democratic hope for a region where other "Arab Spring" nations are caught up in division, intolerance and outright war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-08 14:16:30</td><td>Security is key for Tunisia's vital tourism industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-08 14:16:30</td><td>"All these declarations are quite disturbing," Amna Guellali director of the Human Rights Watch Tunisia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-08 15:01:58</td><td>After Bardo attack, Tunisia treads line between security and freedoms</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-08 15:01:58</td><td>In the cafes and mosques of working-class Tunis, fears are now emerging that a campaign against militants may a spiral into repression like the old days of Tunisia's police state before the freedoms won in a 2011 revolt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-08 15:01:58</td><td>Tunisia has since been held up as a model of democratic transition, the only country where an uprising during what came to be known as the "Arab Spring" did not end in large scale violence or civil war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-08 15:01:58</td><td>But last month's attack is testing Tunisia's tricky balance between security and the new liberties since the revolt, which ousted long-running autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-08 15:01:58</td><td>Fear of repression falls mostly on conservative Salafists and Islamists who were long oppressed by Ben Ali and by his predecessor Habib Bourguiba, seen as the founder of much of Tunisia's secular tradition.</td></tr>
