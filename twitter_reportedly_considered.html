<tr><td>2015-03-08 01:29:43</td><td>MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (AP) - Nigeria's home-grown Boko Haram group, newly weakened by a multinational force that has dislodged it from a score of northeastern towns, reportedly pledged formal allegiance to the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-08 01:29:43</td><td>The pledge to IS came in an Arabic audio message with English subtitles alleged to have come from Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau and posted Saturday on Twitter, according to the SITE Intelligence monitoring service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-08 01:29:43</td><td>The Boko Haram pledge to IS comes as the Nigerian militants reportedly are massing in the northeastern town of Gwoza, considered their headquarters, for a showdown with the Chadian-led multinational force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-08 01:29:43</td><td>The Twitter account, increasingly slick and more frequent video messages from Boko Haram, and a new media arm all are considered signs that the group is being helped by IS propagandists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-08 01:29:43</td><td>Boko Haram in August followed the lead of IS in declaring an Islamic caliphate in northeast Nigeria that grew to cover an area the size of Belgium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-08 04:59:07</td><td>But Boko Haram has never been an affiliate of al-Qaida, some analysts surmise because al-Qaida considers the Nigerians' indiscriminate slaughter of Muslim civilians as un-Islamic.</td></tr>
