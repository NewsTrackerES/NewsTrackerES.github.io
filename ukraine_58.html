<tr><td>2015-03-30 07:38:39</td><td>VIENNA (Reuters) - Billionaire financier George Soros is ready to invest $1 billion in Ukraine, if Western countries help private investment there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-30 07:38:39</td><td>Soros has previously urged the West to step up aid to Ukraine, outlining steps towards a $50 billion financing package that he said should be viewed as a bulwark against an increasingly aggressive Russia.</td></tr>
