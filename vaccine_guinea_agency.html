<tr><td>2015-03-05 11:35:46</td><td>LONDON (AP) - The World Health Organization will start large-scale testing of an experimental Ebola vaccine in Guinea on Saturday to see how effective it might be in preventing future outbreaks of the deadly virus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-05 11:35:46</td><td>The West African nations of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea have been hardest hit in the yearlong Ebola outbreak, which is estimated to have left more than 9,800 people dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-05 11:35:46</td><td>In a statement Thursday, the U.N. health agency said the vaccine study will focus on Basse Guinee, the region that has Guinea's most Ebola cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-05 11:35:46</td><td>The health agency's vaccination strategy in Guinea aims to create a buffer zone around an Ebola case to prevent its further spread - an approach used to eradicate smallpox in the 1970s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-05 11:35:46</td><td>It will take 42 days of no new cases for Liberia to be declared Ebola-free by WHO standards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-05 11:35:46</td><td>The agency said the spread of Ebola remains "widespread" in Sierra Leone and noted that cases have jumped both there and in Guinea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-05 12:40:13</td><td>In a statement issued on Thursday, March 5, 2015, the U.N. health agency said the study will be focused in Basse Guinee, the region that currently has the most Ebola cases in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-05 12:40:13</td><td>"If a vaccine is found effective, it will be the first preventive tool against Ebola in history," WHO chief Dr. Margaret Chan said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-05 12:40:13</td><td>Authorities in Liberia discharged the country's last Ebola patient on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-05 12:40:13</td><td>WHO said only about half of new Ebola patients in Guinea are connected to known cases, meaning that health officials are unable to track where the disease is spreading in the other half of cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-05 12:40:13</td><td>WHO also said unsafe traditional burials - a high-risk factor for Ebola transmission - continue to occur in both Guinea and Sierra Leone, and health workers in those countries are still being attacked by those wary of their efforts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-05 12:40:13</td><td>Officials also said the number of Ebola deaths taking place outside of hospitals still remains high in Guinea and Sierra Leone, "suggesting that the need for early isolation and treatment is not yet understood, accepted or acted upon."</td></tr>
