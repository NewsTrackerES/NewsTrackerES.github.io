Mahal told The Times at a performance Morrison gave last summer outside his hometown of Belfast.</td></tr><tr><td>"What I love about Van so much was that you couldn't categorize him," said Buble, who sings one of his favorite Morrison songs, "Real Real Gone," on the album.</td></tr><tr><td>Morrison's storied back catalog, which stretches back to his recordings with the Irish rock band Them in 1965, encompasses hundreds of songs that he and his duet partners drew from for the new album.</td></tr><tr><td>The album is produced by Morrison with Don Was and Bob Rock.</td></tr><tr><td>Most of the tracks were done with the singers together in the studio, though for a couple - including "These Are the Days" with Cole - scheduling required Morrison to lay down the basic track and his vocal, with his collaborator adding her or his part later.</td></tr><tr><td>As for singing with a musically idiosyncratic singer like Morrison, she said "it was just a matter of getting into his psyche and figuring out where he was going with his vocal.</td></tr></table></td></tr>
