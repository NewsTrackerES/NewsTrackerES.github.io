<tr><td>2015-04-14 14:00:06</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) - It's taken six years for Matthew Morrison to get back on Broadway so it's no surprise he knows a thing or two about where he ended up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-14 14:00:06</td><td>"I just imagine her welcome guests back in her pearls and everything," Morrison said, sipping tea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-14 14:00:06</td><td>Morrison, 36, plays J.M. Barrie, the "Peter Pan" author, in the adaptation from the 2004 whimsical film of the same name about a widow whose four young sons inspired Barrie to write the children's classic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-14 14:00:06</td><td>"There's nothing more challenging or exciting than doing a brand new Broadway show," said Morrison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-14 14:00:06</td><td>The show ended earlier this year and Morrison's last scene was of him singing "Teach Your Children" by Crosby Stills, Nash & Young in dedication to all his fictional students, many who are in tears by the end of the song.</td></tr>
