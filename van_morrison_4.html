Barrie, the "Peter Pan" author, in the adaptation from the 2004 whimsical film of the same name about a widow whose four young sons inspired Barrie to write the children's classic.</td></tr><tr><td>The show ended earlier this year and Morrison's last scene was of him singing "Teach Your Children" by Crosby Stills, Nash & Young in dedication to all his fictional students, many who are in tears by the end of the song.</td></tr><tr><td>Morrison barely had time to say goodbye to Schuester before it was time to tackle Barrie.</td></tr></table></td></tr>
