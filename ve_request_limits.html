<tr><td>2015-03-19 22:21:24</td><td>Iraq has not made a formal request to the US-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group to provide air support in the country's offensive to retake Tikrit, a Pentagon spokesman said Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-19 22:21:24</td><td>The offensive to push back the Islamic State group (IS) from Tikrit began on March 2, and Iraqi forces have only recently reached the city limits where they have been stalled by bombs and entrenched fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-19 22:21:24</td><td>"I am not aware of any request that we've received through official channels to participate in operations around Tikrit," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-19 22:21:24</td><td>"They certainly have Tikrit surrounded. I'm sure there are areas and spots where they are inside the city limits but for the most part they are in the outskirts of Tikrit," he said.</td></tr>
