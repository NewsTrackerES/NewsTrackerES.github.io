<tr><td>2015-04-09 09:10:10</td><td>(Reuters) - A surge in voter turnout helped elect two new black city council members in Ferguson, a Missouri city found by the U.S. Justice Department to be rife with racial abuses in its police and court systems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-09 09:10:10</td><td>The three candidates elected on Tuesday were Ella Jones, an African-American professor; Wesley Bell, an African-American judge; and former Ferguson mayor Brian Fletcher, who is white.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-09 09:10:10</td><td>"Hopefully the new electeds will hold the city to a higher standard with regards to listening and acting on behalf of the under-represented," said state Representative Courtney Curtis, an African-American Ferguson resident.</td></tr>
